# Secret-coding-final-project
A C++ implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing, a cryptographic algorithm that allows a secret to be split into multiple parts (shares) and reconstructed only when a minimum number of shares (threshold) are combined. This project was developed as part of a final assignment for a Data Structures course at CSU.
